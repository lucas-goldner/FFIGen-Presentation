# fluttercon_2023_presentation

An unique experience. A Flutter experience!
Presentation slides, but made in Flutter for the https://fluttercon.dev/ 2023.
Here is my speaker page: https://fluttercon.dev/lucas-goldner/

## Getting Started

_Warning:_ Currently only supports macos,
since the required functionality for the presentation needs access to Apple's APIs.

To run the project use:

```
$ flutter pub get
# If fluttergen is not installed go here: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen
$ fluttergen
# If language files were not generated
$ flutter pub run intl_utils:generate

# Run the app finally
$ flutter run -d macos
```
