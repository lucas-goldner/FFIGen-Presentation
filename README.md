# fluttercon_2023_presentation

An unique experience. A Flutter experience!
Presentation slides, but made in Flutter for the https://fluttercon.dev/ 2023.
Here is my speaker page: https://fluttercon.dev/lucas-goldner/

## Getting Started

_Warning:_ Currently only supports macos,
since the required functionality for the presentation needs access to Apple's APIs.

In order to run the project:

```
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run -d macos
```
